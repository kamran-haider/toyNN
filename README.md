toynn
======


A bare-bones implementation of deep learning neural networks using `numpy`. `toynn` is not comparable to powerful deep learning libraries
such as as `Tensorflow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch` and many others. It's goal is not to train production quality deep learning 
neural networks. It is a personal project born out of a desire to, understand deep learning neural networks by coding them up and gain insights into various tricks that make them so powerful.


Features
--------
* Sigmoid and ReLU layers
* Batch Gradient Descent
* Constant, He and Xavier weight initializations


TODO
----

* Dropout
* L1 and L2 Regularization
* Mini-batch gradient descent


License
-------

* MIT license


Credits
---------

The implementation of deep learning neural networks is this package is inspired from lectures and codes in Andrew Ng's
Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
